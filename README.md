# Hello, I'm Rajan Puri 👋

Welcome to my homepage! 

I currently work as a Vice President, Quantitative Finance Analyst at Bank of America. My main role involves analyzing a large amount of financial data and creating models to help the bank make informed business decisions and effectively manage risks.

Prior to joining Bank of America, I worked as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Wake Forest University.

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Throughout my graduate studies, I actively engaged in campus community and held positions such as Grad Life Fellow and President of the Mathematics Graduate Student Association. I received David Merchant International Student Award from the Phi Beta Delta Honor Society, recognizing my achievements in the areas of scholarship and service.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained an MS degree in Mathematics from Tribhuvan University in Nepal. Additionally, I have three years of experience teaching high school math in Nepal. 

Originally from the beautiful country of Nepal, I have a strong affinity for the mountains and enjoy spending time outdoors in nature. 

Please don't hesitate to connect or reach out if you have any questions. 

Thanks for visiting my profile. Have a great day!
